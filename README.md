##Running the project
1. Install and run the api first to make sure it runs in the port 3000 and the client doesn't take it over:
trv-venue-hotel-api$ npm install
trv-venue-hotel-api$ npm start

2. To run the client execute:

trv-venue-hotel-api$ npm install
trv-venue-hotel-api$ npm start

trv-venue-hotel-api$ $npm run build
